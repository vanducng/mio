"""Schema version enforcement for MIO SDK (publish-side only).

Asymmetry contract (locked — do not relax):
  Publish: verify() / verify_command() hard-reject schema mismatches.
  Consume: NO verify call. Consumers must tolerate unknown major versions to
           remain forward-compatible with future schema additions.
           A schema_version=2 message received on consume MUST pass through
           untouched — rejection is the publisher's responsibility.
