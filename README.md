# MIO — Messaging I/O for MIU

MIO is the messaging I/O platform for [MIU](https://github.com/vanducng/miu).
It connects MIU's AI agents to the chat channels customers actually live in
(Zoho Cliq first, then Slack, Telegram, Discord, …) and gives them a
clean, channel-agnostic envelope to receive messages and respond back.

> Channels are messy. Agents shouldn't care.

## Why decoupled

Every channel webhook has a hard ack deadline (Slack and Discord: 3s).
LLM calls take 2–30s. Coupling them drops messages on the first slow run.

So MIO sits in between:

```
Channel webhook ─► mio-gateway ─► NATS JetStream ─► AI consumer
                       ▲                                │
                       └──── mio-gateway sender ◄───────┘
```

Gateway acks fast, durably persists to a bus, AI service consumes on its
own schedule. Bonus: replay for prompt iteration, failure isolation,
independent scaling, new consumers (analytics, archive) without touching
the receiver.

## Components

| Component | Lang | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway/` | Go | Stateless. One handler per channel for inbound; one consumer pool per channel for outbound. Per-workspace rate limits. |
| `proto/` | Protobuf | Canonical schema. `Message`, `SendCommand`, `Channel`, `User`, `Attachment`. `buf`-managed, versioned. |
| `sdk-go/` | Go | Thin NATS wrapper. Idempotency, OTel, Prometheus, schema-version checks. |
| `sdk-py/` | Python | Same, for the AI side. |
| `sink-gcs/` | Go | Consumer that writes raw payloads to GCS. Cold storage + analytics substrate. |
| `examples/echo-consumer/` | Python | Tiny stub proving the loop. The real agents live in MIU. |
| `deploy/` | — | `docker-compose.yml` for local; Helm charts for GKE. |

## Stack

- **Bus**: NATS JetStream (3-replica on GKE; cloud-agnostic)
- **Schema**: Protobuf via `buf`
- **Storage**: Postgres + pgvector (operational, in MIU); GCS (raw + analytics)
- **Workflow**: Hatchet wraps LangGraph
- **Platform**: GKE for POC; only K8s primitives, no managed lock-in
- **Local dev**: `docker compose` brings up NATS + Postgres + MinIO

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanducng/mio.git
cd mio
mise install            # pins Go 1.23, Python 3.12, buf, protoc
make up                 # NATS + Postgres + MinIO (all three healthy)
make proto              # buf generate → proto/gen/
```

### Port collisions

Default ports: Postgres **5432**, NATS **4222** + **8222**, MinIO **9000** + **9001**.

If any collide with existing local services:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local, then:
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs)
make up
```

See `.env.example` for the full list of overridable variables.

## Design rules — non-negotiable

1. **Gateway is dumb.** Validate signature, normalize, publish, ack. No business logic.
2. **Consumers talk to NATS directly via the SDK.** No proxy service.
3. **Idempotency at the edge.** `(account_id, source_message_id)` unique constraint.
4. **Per-workspace rate limits, not global.** One chatty tenant must not starve others.
5. **Per-thread ordering** via single-replica AI consumer with `MaxAckPending=1`.
6. **Two-step UX for slow LLM calls.** Send "thinking…" immediately, edit-in-place when answered.

Full design doc and phased roadmap live in `docs/system-architecture.md` (incoming).
